The Reading Journal is a web application for book lovers. You can easily add the books you've read 
and write reviews about them. It also lets you set reading challenges to motivate yourself. If you come 
across books that you didn't finish, you can mark them as "DNFs" and even explain why you stopped 
reading them.
